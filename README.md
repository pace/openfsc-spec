# About Connected Fueling

Connected Fueling allows gas stations to secure market share, gain new customers, optimise processes, increase brand awareness and more:

- Chance for true **additional "on-top" business** for the fast-movers in the market as customers will flock to stations where convenient Connected Fueling is available.
- **Attracting customers** to gas stations for other, more sustainable reasons (i.e. convenience, user experience, time savings) than the cheapest price.
- Chances for **"on-top" revenue through data driven up- & cross-selling** via smart offerings (e.g. buyers of premium fuels can be offered premium motor oil) and couponing (e.g. coffee for anyone who has been on the road longer than 2 hours).
- Keeping stations **open overnight** by upgrading regular dispenser pumps (Post Pay or Pre-Auth) to "virtual automatic fuel terminals" (Pre-Auth).
- Higher customer flow rate, i.e. **making sites more efficient** by increasing throughput of dispenser pumps. After refueling, pumps become available more quickly (no more waiting for people to go inside, pay at the POS, come back, move their car).
- **Shortening queues** in the shop as people who only want to pay for fuel can do so on the forecourt.
- Making the **shopping experience better for buyers in the shop** as they feel less pushed by impatient customers paying solely for fuel.
- Building a digital **customer relationship** that can be nurtured over the customer lifetime.
- Creating customer loyalty by offering **state-of-the-art, modern, digital user experience**s.
- Getting a better **grip on data** of your gas station network and the customer flow.
- Adding **innovative**ness and digital prowess to your gas station brand personality.
- Attraction of innovative **early adopter** types who spend more and opt for **premium fuels** more frequently.
- Making the shop **more efficient** overall as there is less manual work at POS (less people to handle).
- **Less cash handling will save costs** and make the whole operation safer.
